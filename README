So these are some odd scripts that are probably only useful to me. The dilemma was that I watch a few TV shows, and I watch them sequentially, and sometimes it's hard to keep track of which episode I left off on for which show. I used to be a heavy user of Fences for windows and just have a copy of the most recent show in a fence, then I could resize the fence to reduce desktop clutter (or the visual side-effect of it).

Linux doesn't have fences, or anything I know of that would be close to it. Then I saw that VLC has a most recent videos menu, showing you the last 10 videos you have watched. That's kind of the idea I was looking for, it would work perfectly if I were only watching a couple different TV shows evenly distributed. But for anything else (namely, my own habits), I would need a much larger history.

So I made two scripts to solve this. One script to make a bigger history, piggybacking of of VLC's .conf file and cron'ing the script to have my own list. And then another script that I can run to query whichever TV show I want (including regex queries). It will respond with the full path of the last entry in the list matching the search/regex. If no matches, it does nothing. Nothing fancy, just a quick hack I put together.
